## Chalk npm package||express JS
#### Basically it helps to highlight your code in terminal. You can separate all your code types using color. 
#### example- `console.log(chalk.blue('Hello world!'));` `console.error(chalk.blue('Hello world!This is an error'))`.
#### You can visit the page- [ChalkDocumentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chalk)
#### I can't run the new version so I have to install the old version -
**`npm install chalk@^4.1.2`**
